The next byte received.

[float]
=== Example 

```
#include <Wire.h>

void setup() {
  Wire.begin();             // Join I2C bus (address is optional for controller device)
  Serial.begin(9600);       // Start serial for output
}

void loop() {
    Wire.requestFrom(2, 6);    // Request 6 bytes from slave device number two
    
    // Slave may send less than requested
    while(Wire.available()) {
        char c = Wire.read();    // Receive a byte as character
        Serial.print(c);         // Print the character
    }

    delay(500);
