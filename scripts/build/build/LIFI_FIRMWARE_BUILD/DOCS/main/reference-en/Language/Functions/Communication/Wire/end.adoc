=== Description

Disable the Wire library, reversing the effect of `Wire.begin()`. To use the Wire library again after this, call `Wire.begin()` again.

*Note:* This function was not available in the original version of the Wire library and might still not be available on all platforms. Code that needs to be portable across platforms and versions can use the `WIRE_HAS_END` macro, which is only defined when `Wire.end()` is available.
