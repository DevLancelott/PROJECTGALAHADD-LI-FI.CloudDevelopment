ðŸ“˜ DOCUMENTATIONS FIRST â€“ Project Development Guidelines

IMPORTANT: This file is part of the project scaffolding and must be read before writing any code or performing integrations.

ðŸ§  PURPOSE

This DOCUMENTATIONS/ directory is the starting point for understanding, planning, and maintaining consistency throughout the development of this project.

All contributors (including AI copilots and scriptwriters) must refer to this documentation first, before:

	â€¢	Implementing logic
	â€¢	Integrating features
	â€¢	Committing code changes

ðŸš¦ PRIORITY RULE

Copilot and other assistants must treat this folder as the entry point.
No code generation, automation, or logic should be initiated until this README and related planning files have been read and understood.

	â€¢	firmware-strategy.md â€“ flashing, protocol and board-specific firmware rules
	â€¢	communication-flow.md â€“ TCP/IP, LI-FI, serial, and fallback communication mapping
	â€¢	build-process.md â€“ environment setup, tools from TOOLS/, and build instructions
