The MKR Therm Shield is a great addon for MKR family boards, and allows you to connect high quality thermocouplers, and can calculate temperatures from -200 °C to +700 °C. An ideal solution to use for ovens, freezers, smokers and similar environments.

To use this shield, you can refer to the documentation of the [Arduino*MKRTHERM library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/arduino*mkrtherm/).
