The following instructions are for Windows 7, Vista and 10. They are valid also for Windows XP, with small differences in the dialog windows. In the following instruction only the Leonardo board will be mentioned, but the same procedure is valid for all the Arduino boards.

Plug in your board and wait for Windows to begin its driver installation process. If the installer does not launch automatically, navigate to the Windows Device Manager (Start>Control Panel>Hardware) and find the Arduino Leonardo listing. Right click and choose **Update driver**.
