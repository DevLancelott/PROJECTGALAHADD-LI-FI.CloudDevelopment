# Mechanical Diagrams

This directory contains SVG versions of official Raspberry Pi mechanical drawings for physical layout, mounting, and mechanical constraints.

## Expected Contents

- `raspberry-pi-4-mechanical-drawing.svg` - Official Pi 4 mechanical drawing
- `raspberry-pi-3-mechanical-drawing.svg` - Official Pi 3 mechanical drawing
- `raspberry-pi-pico-mechanical-drawing.svg` - Official Pico mechanical drawing

## Use Cases

- **Enclosure Design**: Physical dimensions and mounting points
- **Mechanical Integration**: Component placement and clearance
- **Mounting Solutions**: Screw hole locations and board dimensions
- **Thermal Management**: Heat sink placement and airflow considerations

## Integration with Cursor

These diagrams are indexed for intelligent coding assistance:

- Cross-reference with datasheets for validation
- Provide context for hardware design decisions
- Enable mechanical constraint validation during development
