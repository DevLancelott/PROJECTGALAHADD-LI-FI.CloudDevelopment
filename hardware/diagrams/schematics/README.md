# Circuit Schematics

This directory contains SVG circuit schematics for understanding GPIO mappings, power layout, and electrical connections.

## Expected Contents

- `raspberry-pi-4-reduced-schematics.svg` - Pi 4 circuit schematics
- `raspberry-pi-3-reduced-schematics.svg` - Pi 3 circuit schematics
- `raspberry-pi-pico-schematics.svg` - Pico circuit schematics

## Use Cases

- **Circuit Design**: Electrical connections and component placement
- **Power Analysis**: Power distribution and voltage regulation
- **Signal Integrity**: Signal routing and noise considerations
- **GPIO Mapping**: Pin function assignments and multiplexing

## Integration with Cursor

These schematics are indexed for intelligent coding assistance:

- Validate GPIO pin functions against datasheets
- Cross-reference power requirements
- Provide context for electrical design decisions
- Enable signal integrity validation during development

## Key Information

- **Power Rails**: 3.3V, 5V, and ground connections
- **GPIO Banks**: Pin groupings and functions
- **Peripheral Interfaces**: I2C, SPI, UART connections
- **Clock Distribution**: System clock and peripheral clocks
