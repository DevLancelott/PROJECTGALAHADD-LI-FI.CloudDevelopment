      **Is this the right place for my bug report?**

      This repository contains the host tools for booting a Raspberry Pi computer into mass-storage device mode. It also provides tools for updating the bootloader EEPROM and enabling secure-boot on CM4.

      * Please check the [rpiboot troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot#troubleshooting) for advice about diagnosing problems with rpiboot.
      * If you simply have a question, then [the Raspberry Pi forums](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums) are the best place to ask it.
